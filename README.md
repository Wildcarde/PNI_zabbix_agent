# puppet-zabbix-agent-vox
This is the vox populli zabbix module stripped down to only install zabbix agents. I've mostly made this because I run zabbix server in a docker container and want my direct imaged devices to just get an agent w/o bloating my puppet configuration with all the requirements for the server side.
